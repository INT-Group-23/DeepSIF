# DeepSIF: Deep Learning based Source Imaging Framework

Code for: Deep Neural Networks Constrained by Neural Mass Models Improve Electrophysiological Source Imaging of Spatio-temporal Brain Dynamics

* main_train: the main training process, the trained neural network model will be saved in model_result.
* eval_simulation: generate DeepSIF imaging results on sythetic data, evalulate the model performance.
* eval_real: generate DeepSIF imaging results on real data.
* forward/run_tvb: generate sythetic training and texting data.
* anatomy: anatomical information used. See anatomy/README.md for more information.
